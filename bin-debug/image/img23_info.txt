 Woman with a Parasol by Claude Monet<br/>
 This famous painting is also known as Madame Monet and her Son, or ""La Promenade, la femme Ã  l'ombrelle"" in France. The lady with an umbrella painted against the light is Camille, Monet's wife, and the little boy their son Jean.

""I'm working like never and at new attempts, figures in the open air as I understand them, made like landscapes. It is an old ream that still worries me and that I want to fulfill once and for all; but it is hard !"" - Claude Monet

This piece is one of the most famous painting of Monet's early impressionist works. It was painted in a sunny morning, when the lady and her son were walking on the glasses.

Only blue, green, brown and other natural colors are used in the entire painting, that give us a feeling of quiet and comfortable. The lady occupies most of the space of the canvas, she is the center of the canvas. The umbrella and the little son on her right hand side constitute a triangle, bring balance to the whole painting. Although the painting is an early works of Monet, we are still able to see that he successfully captured the light and the impression even at that time. The lady's face and the upper half of the body are painted in more dark colors - they're in the shadow of the umbrella; while the entire umbrella, the face, the skirt, the shadow on the grass are in contrast to the strong light on the umbrella and the skirt (so is the little son), which makes the painting looks real and reasonable. In addition, the swinging headscarf and the folds of the skirt strengthen the dynamic of the painting.
