Guernica by Picasso<br/>Picasso remained neutral regarding the first and second World Wars  and also the Spanish Civil War, refusing to fight or support either side on principle.  Guernica however depicts the German bombing of this Basque city  in the Spanish Civil War and is one of Picasso’s famous works.  ‘The Weeping Woman’ adds a poignant farewell to this period.
