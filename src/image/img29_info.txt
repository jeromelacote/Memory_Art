Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe by Edouard Manet<br/>Le déjeuner sur l'herbe (English, "The Luncheon on the Grass") – originally titled Le Bain (The Bath) – is a large oil on canvas painting by Edouard Manet created in 1862 and 1863. The painting depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings, in the 1863 Salon des Refusés, where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy. The piece is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the Courtauld Gallery, London.
