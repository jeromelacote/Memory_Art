Les Demoiselles d’Avignon by Picasso<br/>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon is probably (along with the Weeping Woman and Guernica) one of Picasso’s famous works.  This painting was based on the artist’s fascination with African masks and Primitive art. Picasso developed Cubism (1909 -1912)  with fellow artist Georges Braque.  By analising shapes, dissecting them then re-assembling them, Picasso was able to create new compositions and perspectives.  Picasso’s preoccupation with Cubism was not met with enthusiasm by most critics at the time.  Undaunted, he carried on exploring this new art form. This period was to last from 1907 to 1917, quite a long time for Picasso.
